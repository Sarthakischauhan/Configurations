#To evaluate a given expression using bc 

#exp="12+4"
#printf "%.3f" $(echo $exp | bc -l)
#printf "%.3f\n" $(echo $sum/$i | bc -l) This is a way to divide two numbers and rounding it
#echo paste -d "delimeter" -s    This will paste the value with a delimeter 
#echo $value | cut -c3 -     This will cut and give the third letter of the word
#echo $value | cut -c 2,7 -     This will cut and give the second and seventh letter of the word
#echo $value | cut -c 2-7 -     This will cut and give the second to seventh letter of the word
#echo $value | cut -f -3     This will using a column based approach 

# In general -f is used so to cut length which are not fixed
